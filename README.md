Tips for my latest research 

1. My name is Ben
2. I am a PhD student doing cancer research.
3. I have optimised, carried out, and currently in the process analysing ATAC-seq data.
4. I use mind maps for getting ideas down. I use a diary to organise my weeks. I organise my files on my computing accoring to expriment type and project. All individual experiments are labbled in chronological order and all files start with the name of a given experiment.
